# emblem-calculator

I got bored one day and decided to make a commandline C program which will calculate the outcome of a battle for Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones.

In all honestly, when I tested it, I never added a support bonus for the calculations, so there is a possibility that those calculations are off.

This should be pretty close to 100% accurate though... I think.

Maybe I'll do more with this some day, for now, it will stand as it is.
